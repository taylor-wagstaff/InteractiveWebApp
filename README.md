# features/functionalities of your application.

I tried to find a good html colour pickers for names but I couldnt find any online. Also, I just really enjoy the colour name tags, I use them all the time but seeing the all colours can be hard to see in VS Code so I decided to build a simple one.
The most important aspect for this application was seeing all the html colour tags in one section, with the names and their corresponding colour as background as well. I wanted a type of placeholder box to preview the colour which was selected followed by an Add colour button 'which adds the colour to the palette from the preview box', clear button 'removes all colours from palette' and random button 'a random colour is added to palette'. I felt these buttons were simple and easy to understand. Lastly, I realised that the colours which were added to the palette didn't have the names to colours so the user could forget which colours were added. It was an easy fix by passing the name to the new box and adding css to reveal on hover.

#  describe the UI design and web accessibility principles you have followed.

The design I wanted to be simple and easy to understand as possible with no extra pointless information or clutter. I hope that it feels intutive at least. Because its so colourful, the rest of the design needed to be minimal, clean with bare functionality. I could have done footer, nav or other tabs but really it doesnt need it at all. Buttons are large and clear for user accesibilty. For Web accessibilty, I tried to use class names which were clear and designate function. I used the simplest language appropriate to my content and audience. I used some semantic structure such as buttons and a header, aside and main, however, I did use div to make it easier for js and styling. To compensate I added aria roles in divs for screen readers. Also, important to declare the language in the html document, "<html lang="en">"






# OVERVIEW
In this practical assessment, you will create a simple interactive app, such as a simple calculator or to-do list, a simple Browser game etc., and implement event handling and DOM manipulation features. 

This written assessment contributes to 40% of the final course grade.


# Create a simple web app of your choice that will allow you to meet the requirements listed in points 2 and 3. Provide a brief description of your app in the project document.

# If you have no ideas for developing a web application, you may implement the calculator app shown below. If you do so, there are two additional functions that you will need to implement. See the paragraph on “Calculator App Requirements” below.

# Apply user interface design principles and processes and ensure main user accessibility principles are followed. You may want to refresh your knowledge of web accessibility and UI design

# Apply appropriate event-handling/DOM manipulation to implement the application’s all functionalities.

# In the project document, please describe the UI design and web accessibility principles you have followed.

# In the project document, please list all the features/functionalities of your application.

# Test your web app and ensure that each interactive feature listed produces the expected outcome for a range of test cases and fixes any bugs.
